# DLD_Rain-And-Fire-Sensor-Alarm
The **Rain and Fire Sensor Alarm** project is designed to detect hazardous environmental conditions such as rain and fire. It uses a combination of **rain sensors** and **flame sensors** connected to an **Arduino Nano** microcontroller to continuously monitor the surroundings. Upon detecting rain or fire, the system activates an **alarm**, which includes a **buzzer** and **LEDs**, while also displaying the real-time status on a **16x2 LCD**. This setup provides immediate alerts to help prevent damage caused by rainwater or fire. It is suitable for a variety of applications, from **home safety** to **industrial monitoring**.

The project aims to enhance **safety and convenience** by offering early warnings of potential hazards. The system is designed for reliability, providing **accurate sensor readings** and a **fast response time** to detect rain or fire. This simple yet effective solution can help homeowners, farmers, and industries minimize damage and ensure safety. It leverages **digital logic design** to process sensor inputs and activate the necessary alerts, demonstrating practical use in **environmental monitoring** and **disaster preparedness**.
